## A couple of notes from true novice

> Hey!

> First of all, just to be clear, I am definitely a NOVICE in the world of statistics. I have no official statistics training besides the online classes that I took. I have a lot to learn from everyone here and I look forward to contribute more to this community as well.

> My shallow observation of successful application of machine learning in the business world is that it usually combines the best of statistics and business.

> With that said, the importance of business knowledge in this loan default competition seems a bit higher than the average importance of business knowledge in other competitions (this generalization may not be 100% correct).

> Fortunately for me, although I do not have extensive statistics background, my professional experience, which involves applying machine learning techniques to solve core credit problems, seems to be a big help here. My familiarity with consumer credit allows me generate some pretty useful features.

> To me, the fun of Kaggle is not only that it allows me to apply the modeling techniques that I learned to improve my models in an iterative manner, but also that it provides the unique opportunity to learn about an entire new business with data provided by world class companies. Being able to figuring out how to find innovative ways to use data and machine learning to solve business problems is immensely satisfying.

> Apologies for the ramble. My amateurish advice is to really learn about consumer credit, and try to form hypothesis around useful features, and then iteratively test them.

> Addition:

> Based on discussion from other posts, it seem forming hypothesis around generating powerful features is especially difficult.

> To that I have two suggestions: 1. Most likely in your country there are bureaus that keeps track of a bunch of credit information and provide a score for loan underwriting. Try to find information about credit metrics that are most impactful in those scores. Then see if you can reverse engineer those features with data in this competition. 2. Learn about consumer credit risk underwriting. There are many papers and articles on that.

> Generating powerful features to split risk is not exactly a science, but definitely not an art.
