</header><p>To be financially literate is to know how to manage your money. This means learning how to pay your bills, how to borrow and save money responsibly, and how and why to invest and plan for retirement.</p><p>Take the initiative to self-educate and grow your financial knowledge, by beginning with the basics of money management and maturing into a smart spender. Putting time into your financial development improves saving and investing decisions. By leveraging resources—like age, talent, money and the ability to establish good habits—you can build a long-lasting nest egg.</p></div></div><div

class="g-b"><h2><span>What is Financial Literacy?</span></h2><p>Managing your money is a personal skill that benefits you throughout your life – and not one that everybody learns. With money coming in and going out, with due dates and finance charges and fees attached to invoices and bills and with the overall responsibility of making the right decisions about major purchases and investments consistently – it’s daunting.</p><p>You would think that because the stakes are so high that this would be a skill that gets taught in high school (or even before), but that’s not the case. Managing your own money requires a fundamental understanding about personal credit and a willingness to embrace personal responsibility. That is, you pay your bills in a timely manner and you don’t drown yourself in debt. You accept the fact that sometimes you have to sacrifice immediate demands and desires for long-term gain.</p></div><div

class="g-b--os g-b--m--1of2"><p
class="mtf">You budget. You save. You protect your savings. When you spend, you spend wisely. When you make big purchases, you do so for things that are worthwhile.</p><p>You understand the difference between good debt and bad debt. And you constantly pay attention to your overall portfolio &#8212; the money that you earn, the savings that you have and the accounts and investments where your savings lie. You also understand what you don’t know, and you ask for help when you need it.</p><p>To be financially literate means having the ability to not let money – or the lack of it – get in the way of your happiness as you work hard and build an American dream complete with a long and fulfilling retirement.</p></div></div></div></div><div

Personal finance experts advise taking the time to learn the basics, from how to manage a checking or debit account to how to pay your bills on time and build from there.</p><p>Managing your money demands constant attention to your spending and to your accounts and not living beyond your financial means.</p></div></div></div></div><div

class="g-b"><h2 class="mtf">Money in the Bank</h2><p>Developing financial acumen starts with opening a bank account. Once you have a paycheck, set up direct deposit. This keeps your money secure and saves you from paying interest to cash advance companies which charge a percentage of your check.</p><p>Having a bank account provides convenience, access to a choice of benefits and safety. Checks and debit cards offer proof of payment so you have a record of transactions showing where your money goes. The FDIC insures money in a savings account for up to $250,000.</p></div><div

class="mtf">There are a number of options for the type of primary account for saving your paychecks. Most people choose a checking, debit or savings account or combination of those. These enable you to set up automatic payments for monthly bills and offer the ease of not having to carry cash around. Each option comes with certain benefits and disadvantages. Evaluate the various overdraft, monthly, withdrawal and other maintenance fees accompanying account options.</p><p>Experts recommend you have a savings account which you can use for handling unexpected financial expenses and emergencies, such as a broken arm, flat tire or hike in school tuition.</p></div><div
class="g-b"><p
class="mtf">Choosing to only open a checking or savings account can be a poor choice, as having the two types of accounts separate helps distinguish between money available for immediate spending and reserves, intended to be kept for the long-term. Keeping all your money in a checking account means you savings are easily accessible and available to spend. You will miss out on interest generated by a savings account.</p></div><div
class="g-b g-b--m--3of4"><p
class="mtf">With money in an account, you can start spending. This is where you need discretion. Learn to differentiate between necessities and luxuries. For example, you need to pay for your yearly dental cleaning, but you want to afford the salon appointment. Take advantage of mobile banking to get updates on how much you are spending and how much remains in your account.</p><p>The best way to leverage the cash you have in your bank account will be to start budgeting immediately.</p></div><div

class="pamm bg-borderbox--blue"><ol><li><span
class="twb">Start tracking your monthly expenses.</span> In a notebook or a mobile app, write in every time you spend money. Be diligent about this, because it’s easy to forget. This is the foundation for your budget.</li><li><span
class="twb">Identify fixed and variable expenses.</span> Fixed expenses are ones that you have every month: rent, mortgage, car payment, electric, bill, water bill, student loan payment. Variable expenses are costs that go up and down each month and ones that come and go – groceries, pet supplies, haircuts, concert tickets, etc.</li><li><span
class="twb">Add up the totals.</span> After three months, calculate how much you are spending, on average, per month. And look at the categories.</li><li><span
class="twb">Study your variable expenses.</span> This is where most people tend to overspend. Decide what gives you the most pleasure from these monthly expenses that you feel these costs are worthwhile? And which ones can you really do without? Be honest, and start cutting. This is the beginning of the hard decisions.</li><li><span
class="twb">Factor in savings.</span> A key part of budgeting is that you should always pay yourself first. That is, you should take a portion of every paycheck and put it into savings. This one practice, if you can make it a habit, will pay dividends (literally in many cases) throughout your life.</li><li><span
class="twb">Now set your budget.</span> Start making the necessary cuts in your fixed and variable expenses. Decide what you want to save every week or every two weeks. The leftover money is how much you have to live on.</li></ol></div><p>Effective budgeting demands that you are honest with yourself and put together a plan that you can actually follow. The more time and effort you put into your budget today, the better you will be able to maintain a life-long savings habit.</p></div></div><div

class="g-b"><h2>Credit or Debit?</h2><p>In addition to cash and a bank account, most people own some type of plastic, like a debit card, credit card or combination of the two. What you do with these tools has serious repercussions on your ability to establish credit history and to avoid developing a borrowing habit.</p><p>Conservative financial experts recommend either having only a debit card or having both with the credit card reserved for occasional major payments and then immediately paid off. This advice is often given to people who have accrued a large amount of debt.</p></div><div

class="g-b--os g-b--m--2of3"><p>Starting out with one of each card can help you develop responsible spending habits and provide convenience. Consider the rewards offered by both cards, especially if you travel or make large purchases often.</p><p>The main advantage of only using a debit card regularly is you spend money you already have. Debit cards can be tied to your checking account where paychecks are automatically deposited.</p><p>Debit cards have benefits like no limit on the amount of transactions and rewards based on frequent use. You have the ability to spend without carrying cash and the money is immediately withdrawn from your account.</p></div><div
class="g-b"><p>Because using the card is so easy, it is vital that you don&#8217;t overspend and lose track of how often you&#8217;re spending with this account. If you&#8217;re not paying attention, overdraft fees can drain your account.</p><p>Some hotels, car rental companies and other businesses require that you use a credit card. Getting an account designed for occasional use can be a wise decision. You can establish your credit history and take advantage of the time buffer between making a purchase and paying your bill. Another advantage of using credit is the added protections offered by the issuer. For online shopping and larger purchases, a credit card can be a safer option than a debit card.</p><p>Relying on a credit card can lead to taking on serious debt. Should you choose to own credit card, the best method of action is paying in full every month. It is likely you will already be paying interest on your purchases and the more time you carry over a balance from month to month, the more interest you will pay.</p></div></div></div></div><div

Using a savings account allows you to prevent emergencies from draining the money you need for monthly bills and slowly build a reserve for making large future purchases. This reserve can be used for car repairs, apartment deposits, unplanned surgeries and other medical needs and even gathering funds for a home down payment.</p><p>Make a financial commitment that you can keep, even if it means starting small, like $50 from every paycheck or cutting out your gym membership for an extra $100 a month. Remember, this account isn&#8217;t for splurging on the latest Apple product or a Michael Kors purse. Be intentional about only using your savings for needs. Whenever you take money out, do your best to quickly replenish the withdrawal.</p><p>Developing consistent savings habits allows you to leverage time, your age, your current resources, compounding interest, investments and tax-advantaged savings.</p></div><div

Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are the primary credit bureaus and assign scores ranging from 300 (high risk) to 850 (low risk). The bureaus determine scores based on a group of factors which reflect your spending habits.</p><p>Never underestimate the importance of credit scores.

class="item-list"><li
class="shadow"><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i><h3>Choosing the Right Card</h3><p>Many credit cards require you meet a minimum credit score for approval. The higher your score, the more perks you will qualify for, like low interest rates and a high credit limit. If you are a student you may qualify for special rates. Decide before you apply for a card what your plan for using the card will be. Pay attention to introductory promotions which may expire after six months to one year of owning a card.</li><li
class="shadow"><i
class="icon-graph"></i><h3>Making a Game Plan for Credit Use</h3><p>Plan before you spend. You can become a responsible credit card owner by marking your calendar to avoid missing or being late for paying credit bills. Another precaution against getting in a borrowing hole is making sure you do not spend money you cannot repay and keeping your balance well below the limit for your account. Ask questions. Are there points you will earn for regular use? Is the APR affordable? What kind of limits will you have? Find out what the fine print means before racking up debt you won&#8217;t be able to repay.</li><li
class="shadow"><i
class="icon-money"></i><h3>Paying Off Credit Card Debt</h3><p>Getting control of your credit card debt requires taking a good look at how much you owe. Take a deep breath and evaluate what you can afford. You likely will need to define a long-term strategy for chipping away at the total amount you owe while ensuring you don’t dig yourself deeper into debt. Talk to creditors to find if they can work with you to make a plan that works. Only look into consolidation and settlement as a last resort.</li></ul></div></div></div><div

href="https://www.annuity.org/annuities/">annuities</a>, which they can purchase with one premium or with series of premiums. Insurance companies issuing annuities guarantee their payouts, hence the security appeal.</p><p>The other retirement advantage that annuities have: their principal investment grows over time, and taxes get deferred until the investment starts paying out. The IRS taxes recipients on the annual distribution rather than the value of the entire account.</p><p>A secondary annuity market exists as well for people who want to shed their annuity or <a
href="https://www.annuity.org/structured-settlements/">structured settlement</a> immediately instead of waiting on it to pay off years from now. This market allows annuity owners to sell their contracts for money. The <a
href="/selling-payments/cash-out/">cash value for such a sale</a> is less than it would be if an owner held on to the investment, but even those who once wanted a retirement investment find themselves needing money now and not later.</p><p>For instance, some people need to pay off unexpected medical bills or family emergency costs. Others want to pay off student loans – or are getting divorce and must make their long-term asset a liquid one. A seller can opt to <a
href="https://www.annuity.org/selling-payments/">sell some or all of their payments</a>, using some money now and saving the rest for later income.</p></div><div

class="pamm bg-borderbox"><ul
class="check-list"><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>Anyone can buy an annuity, and you can shop among a variety of them. You can get a contract that sets up distributions to be paid out immediately, in several months or years or in many years in the future.</li><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>Options include a fixed annuity, which provides a stable payout, or variable investment, which fluctuates based on market changes. Owners can also buy riders, such as the ability to make early withdrawals or the guarantee that payments last throughout the owner&#8217;s entire lifespan.</li></ul></div><div

class="g clear"><div
class="g-b g-b--m--3of4 brdr--r"><p>Begin by looking at how much you think you will need and planning a retirement budget. Fidelity financial corporation urges pre-retirees to have 8 times their annual salary saved by retirement. This general guideline can give you a rough idea of what you&#8217;ll need, but to get a clearer understanding take a look at each part of the picture.</p><div
class="pam bg-borderbox--gr"><ul
class="check-list"><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>What age do you expect to stop working?</li><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>Do you plan to work part-time during retirement?</li><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>What kind of pre-existing health concerns will you need to cover during retirement?</li><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>What kind of retirement benefits does your company offer?</li><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>Will your company provide you with a pension?</li></ul></div><p
class="mbf">These are just a few examples of the questions you want to answer as your put together a retirement strategy. Use resources like the AARP website to find calculators for estimating expenses. You can learn about topics like how inflation will impact the value of your money and how you can expect your health cost to increase with age.</p></div><div
class="g-b--os g-b--m--1of4"><ul
class="check-list"><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>DO consider down-sizing and keeping the money you save to supplement retirement income</li><li><i
class="icon-close"></i>DON&#8217;T forget about 401(k) savings when you move to a new job</li><li><i
class="icon-checkmark"></i>DO decrease risks as you age, like moving from stocks to bonds</li><li><i
class="icon-close"></i>DON&#8217;T put retirement savings as a low-level priority just because it seems to be in the distant future</li></ul></div></div><div

class="g-b--os g-b--m--1of2"><h3 class="mtf">Current Assets</h3><p>Next look at the resources you already have. It&#8217;s never too early to start a saving account. Even though your bank may offer accounts with low interest rates, you can use the decades between now and retirement to slowly build your savings. One way to guarantee you are dedicating a portion of your income to retirement is to set up automatic transfers straight from your paycheck into your savings.</p><p
class="mbf">Get an estimate of your stock portfolio and how assets will mature by retirement age. Use tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. If your employer offers a match plan, try to budget so that you can put in maximum contributions to get the most from this account. The value of 401(k)s has been increasing in recent years, in part due to the stock market.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div

class="cell well"><div
class="palm bg-white-faded"><h3 class="h2 mtf">Looking into the Future</h3><p>Evaluate other sources of retirement income. The Social Security Administration provides an estimator for determining how much your monthly Social Security payments will be. You will notice that the longer you wait for Social Security payments (prior to full-retirement age), the more your monthly payments will be.</p><p>If you’re a veteran, teacher or other government worker, you may have pension payments you can count on. Your retirement benefits can greatly vary depending on your occupation and employer. Make sure you are aware of and participating in any employer-offered retirement plans.</p><p>As you age, periodically gauge the value of your portfolio. You may need to adjust your funds, accounting for market lows or stagnant investments. The older you are, the more you will want to put money toward risk-averse investments like bonds, rather than fluctuating stocks. Additionally, if you fall behind in your retirement account deposits, you may qualify for larger catch-up contributions which would typically be more than the yearly maximum.</p><p>This guide can help you measure your savings progress:</p><div
